DETAILED TASK SUMMARY
==================================================

Health Analyses:
1. IMMEDIATE HEALTH STATUS:
   - Current tremor severity and its implications: The tremor severity is classified as 'Severe' with a tremor_level of 1.169. This indicates significant involuntary shaking which could impact the astronaut's ability to perform tasks accurately and safely.
   - Whether immediate action is needed: Yes, immediate action is needed due to the 'Severe' tremor classification.

2. DETAILED ANALYSIS:
   - Specific tremor characteristics observed: The tremor_max was 2.841, indicating that there were instances of considerable tremors. However, the tremor_min was 0.0, suggesting that there were also periods of no tremors.
   - Correlation with other metrics: The stability score is 0.863, which while not ideal, is not critically low. This suggests that despite the tremors, the astronaut's hand movements remain relatively steady most of the time. The precision_score is 0.961, indicating high precision in hand movements. However, there is a positive trend in tremor values (tremor_trend: 0.633) and a slight negative trend in precision (precision_trend: -0.030), which is concerning.
   - Changes from baseline if available: Without baseline data, it's impossible to determine changes.

3. RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Specific exercises or interventions based on tremor type: The astronaut should perform exercises that help improve fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. Activities like playing a musical instrument or video games that require precise hand movements could be beneficial.
   - Whether medical consultation is needed: Yes, given the 'Severe' tremor classification, a medical consultation should be sought.
   - Monitoring frequency adjustments: Given the severity of the tremors, monitoring frequency should be increased.

4. RISK ASSESSMENT:
   - Current risk level (Low/Medium/High): The current risk level is High due to the 'Severe' tremor classification.
   - Potential complications if untreated: If left untreated, the tremors could significantly impact the astronaut's ability to perform tasks, increasing the risk of accidents. They could also lead to fatigue, stress, and anxiety.
   - Timeline for recommended interventions: Medical consultation should be sought as soon as possible. If medication or therapy is required, it should be started promptly.

1. IMMEDIATE HEALTH STATUS:
   - The current tremor severity is 'Moderate' with a tremor_level of 0.736, which requires immediate attention as per rule 2.
   - Yes, immediate action is needed due to the 'Moderate' tremor classification.

2. DETAILED ANALYSIS:
   - Specific tremor characteristics observed: The tremor_max is 0.949 and tremor_min is 0.614, indicating a significant variation in hand tremors. The tremor_trend is positive at 0.070, suggesting that the tremors may be worsening over time.
   - Correlation with other metrics: The stability_score is 0.885, which although not critically low, should be considered in conjunction with the tremor values. The precision_trend is slightly increasing at 0.011, which might indicate a decline in fine motor control.
   - Changes from baseline: Without baseline data, it's hard to determine how these metrics compare to historical norms for this individual.

3. RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Specific exercises or interventions based on tremor type: Regular physical therapy exercises focusing on hand and arm stability and strength could be beneficial. Activities like rock climbing, weight lifting, or even stress balls could help improve grip strength and reduce tremors.
   - Whether medical consultation is needed: Yes, given the 'Moderate' tremor severity, it would be advisable to consult a medical professional for further evaluation.
   - Monitoring frequency adjustments: Given the current situation, weekly or bi-weekly monitoring would be appropriate to track any changes in the hand tremors.

4. RISK ASSESSMENT:
   - Current risk level: Medium, considering the 'Moderate' tremor severity and its potential impact on astronaut tasks.
   - Potential complications if untreated: If left unaddressed, this condition could lead to decreased productivity, increased risk of injury during tasks, and potential psychological effects.
   - Timeline for recommended interventions: If medical consultation confirms our assessment, interventions should be initiated as soon as possible, ideally within the next few days. Early intervention can help mitigate the progression of symptoms and reduce associated risks.
==================================================
1. IMMEDIATE HEALTH STATUS:
   - Current tremor severity and its implications: The tremor severity is classified as 'Mild' with a tremor_level of 0.3468708824064355. This means that the hand movements are relatively stable but there is a detectable tremor present.
   - Whether immediate action is needed: Yes, immediate action is needed due to rule 2. Any 'Moderate' or 'Severe' tremor classification requires immediate attention.

2. DETAILED ANALYSIS:
   - Specific tremor characteristics observed: The tremor_max value is 0.8461111720958919, indicating that the tremor has reached moderate levels at times. The tremor_trend is negative (-0.27362986468180006), suggesting that the tremor is decreasing over time.
   - Correlation with other metrics: The stability_score is 0.9280857415259547, which is relatively high, meaning the hand movements are generally steady. However, the presence of a tremor despite the high stability score may be indicative of an underlying neurological issue.
